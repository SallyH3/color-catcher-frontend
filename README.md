# Color Catcher

## Abstract:

As a paired project, we created an app similar to [coolors](https://coolors.co/) where a user can add projects with unique names, add palettes with unique names to their projects, "catch"/"release" a specific color in each palette (locks a color and unlocks a color), remove a palette from a project, and remove a project. 

Each API endpoint responds with JSON-formatted data and you can view the backend repository for this project [here](https://github.com/lboyer4/color-catcher-backend).

Deployed on Heroku: [Color Catcher](https://color-catcher.herokuapp.com/)
